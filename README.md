# Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study
## This project is designed to demonstrate the process by which I analysed the ficticious company Cyclistic to complete the capstone as part of Google Data Analytics Certficate program.

Please see the Wiki Pages I have setup for this project that provide long form detail on the steps I took to arrive at the conclusions I found and recommendation I make based on the data set provided for this case study.

I utilized Coursera's certfication study platform as part of the training program. For more information about the program, please visit [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) page for more information.
